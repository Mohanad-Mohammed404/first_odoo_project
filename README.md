# first_odoo_project
This project is about students registration to join colleges and allowing them to enter their own data and in the second menu they can enter thier desires, skills and thier talent

I've used the simple things I've learned till now in Odoo course to improve my skills in this platform.
In national ID I used ValidationError predefined exception class to raise Error message if user input is not a number or not 14 digits.
In family members I created it as a Many2many field and make a tree view for this table in the main form.
I added archive and un archive to the record if user want to see archived records
I'm also used tracking in some fields to know if any user change any data in saved records.
I used filter and search panel in both actions, in Student data the search panel is filtered by gender and in Student desire is filtered by expected college.
I added a section in the form that allow user to add comment or review the activity.
